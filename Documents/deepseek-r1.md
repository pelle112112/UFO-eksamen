Key Features
Performance Optimization:

Uses OpenCV's highly optimized GaussianBlur function

Includes timing functionality to measure performance

Processes the image in memory for efficiency

Readability and Maintainability:

Clear separation of concerns

Type hints throughout

Comprehensive docstrings

Logging functionality

Reliability:

Proper error handling

Input validation

Unit tests for critical functionality

Flexibility:

Configurable kernel size and sigma parameters

Works with any image path

Easy to adjust blur intensity

The project will automatically create the necessary output directories and log files when run. The performance metrics will be both printed to the console and logged to logs/performance.log.
